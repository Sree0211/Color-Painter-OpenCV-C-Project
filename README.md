# Color Painter: OpenCV C++ Project

## Overview
The Color Painter project is a fun and creative application developed using OpenCV in C++. It allows users to interact with the computer's camera or images to paint using different colors in real time. By simply waving an object of a specific color in front of the camera, users can create colorful masterpieces.

## Features
Real-time Color Painting: Paint with different colors in real-time using the camera feed.
Color Detection: Detect specific colors (e.g., red, blue, green) from the camera feed or uploaded images.
Interactive UI: Easy-to-use user interface for intuitive interaction.

## Technical Details
The Color Painter project utilizes OpenCV's computer vision capabilities to detect specific colors in the camera feed. It then maps the detected color to paint color and allows users to create art by moving the colored object in front of the camera. The project involves color space conversion, contour detection, and real-time video processing.
